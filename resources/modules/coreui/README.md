Curious why I decided to create CoreUI? Please read this article: [Jack of all trades, master of none. Why Bootstrap Admin Templates suck.](https://medium.com/@lukaszholeczek/jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none-5ea53ef8a1f#.7eqx1bcd8)

## Installation

Several options are available:

### Clone repo

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/coreui/coreui.git
```

### NPM

``` bash
$ npm install @coreui/coreui --save
```

### Yarn

``` bash
$ yarn add @coreui/coreui@2.1.16
```

### Composer

``` bash
$ composer require coreui/coreui:2.1.16
```

## Usage

### CSS

Copy-paste the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>` before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@coreui/coreui/dist/css/coreui.min.css">
```

### JS

Many of our components require the use of JavaScript to function. Specifically, they require [jQuery](https://jquery.com), [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and our own JavaScript plugins. Place the following `<script>`s near the end of your pages, right before the closing `</body>` tag, to enable them. jQuery must come first, then Popper.js, then Bootstrap, and then our JavaScript plugins.

``` html
<script src="node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/popper.js/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/@coreui/coreui/dist/js/coreui.min.js"></script>
```

There is only one limitation you can't can‚Äôt re-distribute the CoreUI as stock. You can‚Äôt do this if you modify the CoreUI. In past we faced some problems with persons who tried to sell CoreUI based templates.

## Support CoreUI Development

CoreUI is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use. However, the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features for the project is not sustainable without proper financial backing. You can support development by donating on [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/holeczek), buying [CoreUI Pro Version](https://coreui.io/pro) or buying one of our [premium admin templates](https://genesisui.com/?support=1).

As of now I am exploring the possibility of working on CoreUI fulltime - if you are a business that is building core products using CoreUI, I am also open to conversations regarding custom sponsorship / consulting arrangements. Get in touch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lukaszholeczek).
