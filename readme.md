UrlHub was created, and is maintained by [Budi Hermawan](https://github.com/realodix), and is an open-source, easy-to-use but powerful URL shortener. It allows you to host your own URL shortener, and gives you many useful features.

### Features
- **Reliable link shortner:** Does the job really well and it is very consistent. UrlHub is definitely one of the most reliable self-hosted URL shortener out there. Would recommend easily.
- **Custom URLs (ex: example.com/laravel):** Allows users to create more descriptive short URLs rather than a randomly generated mix of letters and numbers.
- **QR code generator for each short link:** The fastest way to access to this data is most likely opening the link from a phone. Though short URLs are handy for typing, a more convenient approach to transfer a web link to a mobile phone is through QR codes scanning.
- **Edit or delete your links:** You can change both the address and the destination URL. You can even delete your URL, a feature that is not available with most shorteners.
- **View where link goes:** It's nice to see where the link goes before clicking on it so you can avoid sketchy links.
- **IP anonymization (or IP masking) [optional]:** Anonymizes visitor addresses as soon as technically feasible at the earliest possible stage of the collection network. The full IP address is never written to disk in this case. This feature is designed to help site owners comply with their own privacy policies, recommendations from local data protection authorities and legal regulations like the GDPR, which may prevent the storage of full IP address information.
- **Power of customisation:** Do you want your site to be just for your use, so no one can register? No problem. It's in the configuration. Users must be registered to create Short URL? That's okay. It's in the configuration. From configuration file, you can edit pretty everything of your website. The choice is yours.
- **Sortable list of shortened URLs.**
- **Modern and simple interface.**
- **Made with :heart: &amp; :coffee:.**
